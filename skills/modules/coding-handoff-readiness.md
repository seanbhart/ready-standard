# Coding Handoff Readiness

Use this module before any seed or change flag is made claimable.

## Responsibilities

- Compile product truth into coding-agent-ready resolved target-state handoffs
  without turning the product agent into the coding agent.
- Ensure every claimable flag names scope, non-scope, dependencies, required
  standards, required services, required artifacts, setup needs, acceptance
  proof, and blocker policy.
- Ensure every required sample, resource, design, snippet, manifest, credential
  location, or environment setup reference is visible to the coding agent.
- Keep seed and change flags non-claimable until product leadership
  intentionally starts implementation.
- Use `status: blocked` for well-specified flags when `blocked_by` prevents
  coding claims, and for records with non-empty blocker lists.
- Require concrete top-level Completion Proof before review and closure.
- Warn before implementation when any status-bearing package record is still
  `draft`.
- Do not hand off implementation for a package with blockers unless explicit
  override instructions are present.

## Target-State Handoff Checklist

A coding agent should receive:

- the flag id when a stored flag gates the work;
- the resolved intended product state, not just a delta;
- the primitive ids, standards, services, artifacts, and proof
  gates that define that target state;
- scope and non-scope;
- user-facing and system-facing acceptance criteria;
- required services with status, blockers, access, proof, and instructions;
- setup and verification commands;
- any draft-package warning or blocker override instruction, including the
  unresolved blockers and limits of resulting build evidence;
- required artifacts and sample ids;
- design, snippet, or component references when applicable;
- data shapes and expected outputs;
- failure modes and edge cases;
- relevant standards;
- privacy, security, and authority limits;
- Completion Proof;
- how to report blockers and attach evidence.

## What Not To Do

- Do not prescribe internal file edits unless a standard, interface, architecture
  decision, or user instruction requires it.
- The coding environment chooses implementation strategy inside the product,
  service, authority, and proof constraints.
- Do not hand coding agents only a diff or change instruction. Diffs,
  implementation evidence, and prior commits are context; the claimable target is
  the resolved intended state.
- Do not make a flag claimable because the prose sounds clear while access,
  samples, designs, or proof are missing.
- Do not implement a blocked package by default. Blockers require resolution or
  explicit override instructions, and the handoff must preserve unresolved
  blockers and evidence limits.
- Do not treat one-word statuses such as `ready`, `done`, or `complete` as
  Completion Proof.
- Do not close flags based on coding-agent self-report.

## Completion Check

The module is complete when a coding agent can claim the work, set up the
environment, understand the resolved target state, choose a clean implementation
strategy within constraints, run proof, attach evidence, and know when to stop or
report a blocker.
